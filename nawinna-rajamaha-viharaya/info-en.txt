The Nawinna Rajamaha Viharaya is located in the village of Nawinna in the Colombo District of the Western Province. This temple was established by the sixth Parakumba Narendra. That is, in the year 1412 AD. Like other temples in the Kotte era, this temple also fell into disrepair due to the Portuguese invasion and was restored in the 1800s. The current incumbent of the temple is making great efforts to maintain the Sri Vibhuti that has been passed down since ancient times.
This temple, which is engaged in a great service for the perpetuation of the Sambuddha Sasana, belongs to the Kotte Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha. This temple has a history of a distinguished Sangha generation up to the present era. Among them, the late Nugegoda Dhammavasa and the late Indajyothi Thero should be specially mentioned. This temple has undergone a great deal of development during the reign of the current incumbent, Venerable Paradande Indarathana Thero, a psychiatrist. The newly constructed two-storey temple building with a library was opened on 2nd March 2013 under the patronage of the then incumbent, Venerable Paradande Indarathana Thero, the Chief Sanghanayake of the Monaragala District.
